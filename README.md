### What is this repository for? ###
This is game made it by xamarin form platform ,We get three app versions (IOS, Android, UWP) 

Game description:

Objects fall from the top of the screen to the bottom of the screen. The horizontal position of the object is random every time an object falls. The fall interval between the objects is also random. Always at least 1 object must be falling and there may be multiple falling objects at the same time visible.
We capture the objects by clicking or touching them. Every object caught increases the score, each missed object decreases the score.
After 30 seconds, the game ends and the score is added to the score list, along with the player name. The score list must be kept permanently, so that it is still available at the next round.


This is screen shot from UWP version
